# Apache SkyWalking Go Release Guide

This documentation guides the release manager to release the SkyWalking Go in the Apache Way, and also helps people to check the release for vote.

## Prerequisites

1. Close(if finished, or move to next milestone otherwise) all issues in the current milestone from [skywalking-go](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-go/milestones) and [skywalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/milestones), create a new milestone if needed.
2. Update [CHANGES.md](../../../CHANGES.md).
3. Check the [dependency licenses](../../../dist/LICENSE) including all dependencies.

## Add your GPG public key to Apache svn

1. Upload your GPG public key to a public GPG site, such as [MIT's site](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/). 

1. Log in [id.apache.org](https://id.apache.org/) and submit your key fingerprint.

1. Add your GPG public key into [SkyWalking GPG KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking/KEYS) file, **you can do this only if you are a PMC member**.  You can ask a PMC member for help. **DO NOT override the existed `KEYS` file content, only append your key at the end of the file.**

## Build and sign the source code package

```shell
export VERSION=<the version to release>
git clone git@github.com:apache/skywalking-go && cd skywalking-go
git tag -a "v$VERSION" -m "Release Apache SkyWalking-Go v$VERSION"
git push --tags
make release
```

**In total, six files should be automatically generated in the directory**: `apache-skywalking-go-${VERSION}-bin.tgz`, `apache-skywalking-go-${VERSION}-src.tgz`, and their corresponding `asc`, `sha512` files.

## Upload to Apache svn

```bash
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/
mkdir -p skywalking/go/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-go/apache-skywalking*.tgz skywalking/go/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-go/apache-skywalking*.tgz.asc skywalking/go/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-go/apache-skywalking*.tgz.sha512 skywalking/go/"$VERSION"

cd skywalking/go && svn add "$VERSION" && svn commit -m "Draft Apache SkyWalking-Go release $VERSION"
```

## Vote Check

All PMC members and committers should check these before voting +1:

1. Features test.
1. All artifacts in staging repository are published with `.asc`, `.md5`, and `sha` files.
1. Source codes and distribution packages (`skywalking-go-$VERSION-{src,bin}.tgz`)
are in `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/go/$VERSION` with `.asc`, `.sha512`.
1. `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` are in source codes and distribution package.
1. Check `shasum -c skywalking-go-$VERSION-{src,bin}.tgz.sha512`.
1. Check `gpg --verify skywalking-go-$VERSION-{src,bin}.tgz.asc skywalking-go-$VERSION-{src,bin}.tgz`.
1. Build distribution from source code package by following this command, `make build`.

Vote result should follow these:

1. PMC vote is +1 binding, all others is +1 no binding.

1. Within 72 hours, you get at least 3 (+1 binding), and have more +1 than -1. Vote pass.

   Thank you for voting, I’ll continue the release process.

## Remove Unnecessary Releases

Please remember to remove all unnecessary releases in the mirror svn (https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking/), if you don't recommend users to choose those version.
For example, you have removed the download and documentation links from the website. 
If they want old ones, the Archive repository has all of them.
